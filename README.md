#Aid Apple in restructuring the executive team
Because of recent security breaches, Apple has decided that each member of their executive team can only handle overseeing 2 other people at a time.

They are restructuring the team to look like this:
</br>
Name | Report 1 | Report 2
--- | --- | ---
Tim | Jony | Phil
Phil | Craig | Eddie
Jony | Dan | Katie
Katie | Peter | Andrea
</br>
This tree data structure reorganizes the exexutive team and the results are printed out below.
